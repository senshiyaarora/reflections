How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

This happens bcoz u need not to locate the bug. Someone will locate just rectify.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Just locate the prev files...and thus bugs...rollbck possible with this.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: It will give u flexibility
Cons: Needs to be vigilent to commit every logical change.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google docs is not made for code.Changes text is there only.Unnecessary saves.Git is more concerned with code and compilation.
