When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I am working on a shared project and need to make minor changes for which push is not that much relevant.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branch is used to work on the existing repository but in the sense adding a new feature or making some other experimental changes.
Cloning refers to create a copy of the repository either from local machine to local machine or from remote machine to local machine.
Forks refers to cloning a repository on Github from one account to another on Github itself.
